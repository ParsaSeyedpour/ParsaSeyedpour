 I'm Parsa!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a developer, researcher, and educator passionate about the intersection of **neuroscience**, **biomedical signal processing**, and **software engineering**. I build real-world applications that bridge the gap between data science and human experience — from emotion-aware systems to robust backend APIs.

## 📊 Data Science & Research Interests
I work on projects like:

- 🧠 **Neuroscience Projects**:  
  - EEG-based **emotion detection** during music listening using **Muse** device & public datasets (like DENS from OpenNeuro)
  - Brainwave feature extraction (alpha, beta, theta), deep learning classification (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
  
- 🧬 **Neuroimaging & Functional Connectivity**:  
  Using Python tools like **nilearn**, **mne**, and **nibabel**I to visualize brain activity, model cognition, and detect neurological patterns.

- 🔬 **Clinical Research Tools**:  
  - ECG artifact detection, signal preprocessing, patient monitoring
  - Biomarker analytics (e.g., miR-21, NLR) for cancer and pulmonary studies


- 📰 **Machine Learning Projects**:  
  - Fake news detection with classic ML (LogReg, XGBoost) and deep learning (LSTM)
  - COVID-19 time-series + geographic EDA with **Plotly**, **Folium**, **pandas**
  - Regression-based case prediction models

## 🛠️ Backend Development

I specialize in designing and deploying robust backend systems using:

- **FastAPI** & **Django REST Framework** for high-performance APIs
- **JWT-based Authentication**, email verification, and role-based access control
- **Dockerized microservices** deployed via **Render**, **Vercel**, and **GitHub Actions**
- **WebSockets + Redis** for real-time communication (e.g., chat apps)
- **Multi-language support** (English, Persian, French)
- **Stripe/PayPal integration**, file uploads, and localization

Some projects I’ve worked on include:
- Multi-vendor e-commerce platforms
- Real-time chat applications
- Persian voice API using TTS
- Secure user systems with CI/CD pipelines
